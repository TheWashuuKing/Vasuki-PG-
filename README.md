V (ヴィー, Vī) or Vasuki (ヴァスケイ, Vasukei) was a secret organization that operates in the shadows and fulfills an agenda of maintaining a "balance" of the human and ghoul societies. Their efforts to maintain this ostensible "equilibrium" have been failing because of the ghoul terrorist organization, Aogiri Tree, and its leader, the One-Eyed Owl. The cabal is aiming to eliminate this faction because of the danger to its policy.
